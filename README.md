# Automated-Wireless-Master-Slave-Path-Following-Robot-System
The objective of this project was to
establish a wireless communication between robots which
operate in master-slave architecture. The proposed
approach helped in achieving the desired outcome using
RF communication concepts. Multiple robots grouping
together to perform a task allows robots to achieve the
result in less time and reduced complexity and also reduces
human interaction.This ideology was exploited and put to
use in this very project. The key idea was to create
individual bots amidst which one of the bots serves as the
Master bot and the other bot serve as the Slave bots and as
per the definition the Master bot serves its purpose of
executing the main task. A PID controller was designed to
accomplish a straight path motion. The communication
between the bots was achieved using wireless RF
transmission technique. An intelligent slave bot was built
that adopts collision preventive methods. Hence the bots
work in tandem to achieve a common goal and accomplish
the task without the need for human intervention other
than the supervision of the master bot.
